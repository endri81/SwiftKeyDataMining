Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. [SwiftKey](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey), built a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices.   One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models When user types some text,  the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be.   The aim of this project is to build  a predictive model of  text and illustrate its functionality in a Shiny App.
